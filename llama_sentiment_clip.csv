We're not talkin' about no baseball! Rose, you're not listening to me. I'm trying to explain it to you
the best way I know how. It's not easy for me to admit that I've been standing
in the same place for 18 years! Well, I've been standing with you! I've been right here with you, Troy!
I got a life, too. I gave 18 years of my life
to stand in the same spot as you! Don't you think
I ever wanted other things? Don't you think
I had dreams and hopes? What about my life? What about me? Don't you think it ever crossed my mind
to want to know other men? That I wanted to lay up somewhere
and forget about my responsibilities? That I wanted someone
to make me laugh, so I could feel good? You're not the only one
who's got wants and needs. But I held on to you, Troy. I took all my feelings,
my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you. I planted a seed
and watched and prayed over it. I planted myself inside you
and waited to bloom! And it didn't take me no 18 years
to realize the soil was hard and rocky, and it wasn't never gonna bloom! But I held on to you, Troy.
I held you tighter. You was my husband. I owed you everything I had. Every part of me I could find to give you. And upstairs in that bedroom,
with the darkness falling in on me, I gave everything I had
to try and erase the doubt that you wasn't the finest man
in the world. And wherever you was going,
I was gonna be there with you, because you was my husband. 'Cause that's the only way
I was gonna survive as your wife. You always talking about what you give
and what you don't have to give. But you take, too, Troy. You take
and don't even know nobody's giving. You say I take and don't give. Troy, you're hurting me. - Troy, you're hurting my arm, let go!
- I gave you everything I got. Don't you tell that lie on me. - Mama!
- Don't you tell that lie! Troy, you're hurting me! Troy! Troy! All right. That's strike two. You stay away from around me, boy.

a book. He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so proud of him. I am. He wrote you a letter. And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you. Jenny, I don't know if Mama was right, or if it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're all just floating around

all right? Ah. Mmm, that's it, isn't it? You married the wrong woman. What happened?
What, did she leave you? Was she, you know,

LegallyBlonde,"- Excuse you. You're in my way.
- She's a student. She can't defend you. Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court Ruling 3.03. See? - Thank you, David.
- Counselors, approach the bench. - You're not going up there.
- Oh, yes, I am. I'm sorry. Maybe you
didn't hear me. You're fired. Counselors, now! All of you. Elle Woods, Your Honor. Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court
states that a law student may appear on behalf
of a defendant in criminal proceedings Your Honor,
I have no problem with this. - I do. I'm not allowing it.
- But you agreed last night. In your office,
when we were discussing my career? The ruling also states that you need
a licensed attorney to supervise you. - Mr. Callahan?
- That I won't agree to. I'll supervise, Your Honor. Well, then, Ms. Woods, proceed. Thank you, Your Honor. (chuckling) - Hi.
- Hi. Enjoy prison. Mrs. Windham,
you do realize what you're doing? Absolutely. - Oh, my God. There she is. Elle!
- Elle, we came to see your trial. Oh, look, how cute! There's, like,
a judge and everything. And jury people. - Vote for Elle!
- Ladies, take a seat. Go, girl. Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do.
- Be seated. Ms. Woods, you may
begin your questioning. First of all, I would like
to point out that, not only is there
no proof in this case, but there's a complete
lack of mens rea, which, by definition,
tells us that there can be no crime without a... vicious will. I am aware of the meaning of mens rea. What I'm unaware of is why
you're giving me a vocabulary lesson when you should be
questioning your witness. Yes, Your Honor. Ms. Windham... When you arrived back at the house... ...was your father there? Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs
to take a shower. And... when you came downstairs,
what happened? I saw Brooke standing over his body... ...drenched in his blood. - But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
- No, she'd stashed it by then. Move to strike that
from the record, Your Honor. - It's speculation.
- So stricken. Go ahead. Ms. Windham, did you hear a shot fired? No. I was in the shower. OK. So... sometime in the 20 minutes that you were in the shower... ...your father was shot? I guess. Your father was shot
while you were in the shower... ...but you didn't
hear the shot because... ...because you were in the shower? Yes. I was washing my hair. - (barks) - Where is she going with this?
- Have a little faith, Gerard. Ms. Windham,
what had you done earlier that day? I got up, got a latte, went to the gym,
got a perm and came home. Where you got in the shower? I believe the witness has made it
clear that she was ""in the shower."" (all chuckling) Yes, Your Honor. Ms. Windham,
had you ever gotten a perm before? - Yes.
- How many, would you say? Two a year since I was 12. You do the math. You know, a girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. We all tried to talk her out of it.
Curls weren't a good look for her. She didn't have your bone structure. Aww. But thankfully, that same day, she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wet T-shirt contest, where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe. Objection! Why is this relevant? - I have a point. I promise.
- Then make it. Yes, ma'am. Chutney, why were Tracy Marcinko's
curls ruined when she got hosed down? - Because they got wet.
- Exactly. Because isn't it the first cardinal
rule of perm maintenance that you're forbidden
to wet your hair for at least 24 hours after getting a perm
at the risk of deactivating -the ammonium thioglycolate?
- Yes... And wouldn't somebody who's had,
say 30 perms before in their life be well aware of this rule? And if you weren't washing your hair,
as I suspect you weren't, because your curls are still intact,
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot? And if, in fact, you had heard the
gunshot, Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide
the gun before you got downstairs, which would mean that you would've
had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make
your story plausible. Isn't that right? She's my age, did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father
married someone your age? You, however, had time to hide the gun,
didn't you, Chutney? - After you shot your father.
- I didn't mean to shoot him! I thought it was you
walking through the door! (crowd exclaiming) Order! Order! Order. - Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Bailiff, take the witness into custody, where she will be charged
for the murder of Heyworth Windham. In the matter of
The State v. Brooke Windham, this case is dismissed. Mrs. Windham, you are free to go. Yes! (all cheering)",6

and just feel so gross! - I felt repulsed when you touched me!

before you met me, it's pathetic. People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist. And I used to defend you. They were absolutely right. All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack! You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain! You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy? Fine, but you and I both know
you chose this life! You wanted it until you didn't! You used me so you could get out of LA. I didn't use you. You did, and then you blamed me for it! You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong, how I was falling short! Life with you was joyless! What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else? You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her! You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her! Do you love her? No. But she didn't hate me. You hated me. You hated me. You fucked somebody we worked with. You stopped having sex with me
in the last year. I never cheated on you. That was cheating on me! But there was so much I could have done. I was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking <i>Time Out New York!</i> I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't. And I loved you
and I didn't want to lose you. But I'm in my twenties,
and I didn't want to lose that too, and I kinda did! And you wanted so much so fast. I didn't even want to get married. And fuck it! There's so much I didn't do. - Thanks for that!
- You're welcome! I can't believe
I have to know you forever! You're fucking insane! And you're fucking winning! Are you kidding me? I wanted to be married. I'd already lost! You didn't love me as much as I loved you! What does that have to do with LA? What? You're so merged

as selfishness anymore! You're such a dick! Every day I wake up

We close now. Now is not a time. What time do you close? Generally around dark. At dark. You don't know what you're
talking about, do you? Sir? I said you don't know
what you're talking about. What time do you go to bed? Sir? You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed? Somewhere around 9:30. I'd say around 9:30. I could come back then. Why would you be coming back? We'd be closed. Yeah. You said that. Well... I got to close now. You live in that house out back? Yes I do. You lived here all your life? This is my wife's father's place. Originally. You married into it. We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago. You married into it. If that's the way you wanna put it. I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is. What's the most you've
ever lost in a coin toss? Sir? The most you ever lost in a coin toss. I don't know. I couldn't say. Call it. Call it? Yes. For what? Just call it. Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here. You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. I didn't put nothing up. Yes, you did. You've been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin? No. 1958. It's been traveling
twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails. And you have to say. Call it. Look... I need to know what I stand to win. Everything. How's that? You stand to win everything. Call it. Alright. Heads then. Well done. Don't put it in your pocket. Sir? Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter. Where you want me to put it? Anywhere not in your pocket. Or it'll be mixed in with the
others and become just a coin. Which it is.",6
ParentTrap,"Thanks. Oh, gosh. It's him. Hey, Hal! Welcome home, kiddo. - Get into these arms, you little punk.
- Dad. Finally. Oh, I hope you had a lousy time at that
camp because you are not going back. I missed you too much. What happened to you, Hal? Something's changed. Are you getting taller? So, what's up, Dad? I mean, how's Chessy and everybody? Great. Everybody's great.
Can't wait to see you. Eight weeks really is too long, Hal.
A lot's been happening around here. A lot's happened to me too, Dad. I mean, I feel like
I'm practically a new woman. What's the matter? I cut myself shaving? No, it's just... just seeing you
for the first time. I mean, you know... in so long. You look taller to me too, Dad. Come on, squirt. Let's get home. <i>Oh, by the way,
thanks for all those newsy letters.</i> I'm really glad I bought you
all that personalized stationery you just had to have. - We meant to write, Dad, but we just...
- ""We?"" Oh, me and my friend. I met this girl
at camp and we got really close. Great. Practically like sisters. - She was a lovely girl.
- ""Lovely girl?"" What, all of a sudden you're so proper? - Still biting those nails, I see.
- Dad, you noticed! What do you mean, ""noticed?"" You've
been biting them since you could chew. But I've decided to stop, Dad.
It's a horrid habit. ""Lovely girl,"" ""horrid habit."" What did I do, send you
to summer camp or finishing school? And why do you keep saying ""Dad""
at the end of every sentence? I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was doing it, Dad. Sorry, Dad. Do you want to know
why I keep saying ""Dad?"" The truth? 'Cause you missed
your old man so much, right? Exactly. It's because in my whole life - I mean,
you know, for the past eight weeks - I was never able to say the word ""Dad.""
Never. Not once. And if you ask me, a dad is an irreplaceable person
in a girl's life. Think about it. There's a whole day
devoted to celebrating fathers. Just imagine someone's life
without a father. Never buying a Father's Day card. Never sitting on their father's lap. Never being able to say, ""Hi, Dad!"" or, ""What's up, Dad?""
or, ""Catch you later, Dad."" I mean, a baby's first words
are always ""Dada,"" aren't they? Let me see if I get this.
You missed being able to call me ""Dad?"" Yeah. I really have, Dad. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Now you're starting
to sound like your old self. Hello, gorgeous! Oh, look at you! Oh, you grew. Oh, we missed you so much. Hey. Don't you dare let your old man
talk you out of going back to camp, OK? You're a growing girl. You need adventure. - OK.
- You hungry? I made corn bread and chili. - Why are you so quiet? What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's just I'm so happy to be home. Hey, did I hear something
about corn bread and chili? Yeah, it's on the stove. So... Something's changed about you, Hal.
Hm. I can't put my finger on it, but something about you
has definitely changed. Really? Well, it's just the same old me. Honest. Hi, Sammy! What is wrong with you, you goofball?
It's Hallie. Oh, I probably just
smell like camp, that's all. What's the matter with you?
It's like you didn't even recognize her. Wow, it's even better than the pictures. OK, kiddo.
What do you want to do first, huh? You want to eat and then unpack,
or we could unpack and then eat. Or we could eat while we unpack. You mean I can eat in my room? Yeah, it's a definite possibility. Hey, Hal. When you're done, come on
down. There's someone I want you to meet. - OK, Dad.
- OK, Hal. Look at you, always eating. - Did you tell her?
- No. Oh, Nicky. Tell me what? Hal, it is none of my business how your
father makes a fool out of himself, OK? - He's a big boy. He can do what he wants.
- OK, OK. So, who is she? Her name's Meredith Blake.
She's a publicist from San Francisco. Your father hired her
at the beginning of the summer to do some publicity for the vineyard. If you ask me, she's doing a better job
of selling herself than the grapes. What do you mean? Look, you and I both know your father's
not some kind of suave, debonair, bachelor-of-the-month type. So I gotta ask myself,
what does a hot young thing like that see in a guy who walks around
with his shirttail hanging out and a cereal bowl full of chili. Then I realized there's about a million
reasons why that girl's giggling. All of them are sitting
at the Napa Valley Community Bank. You mean, you don't think
she even really likes him? Ah, what do I know?
But I tell you one thing, this one's got your father
eating out of the palm of her hand. They do everything together.
They ride together, they swim together. They go out to eat dinner every night. Do you know what? Meet her. See
for yourself. Don't let me influence you.",5
PulpFiction,"Hey, kids.
How you boys doin'? Hey, keep chillin'. You know who we are? We're associates of your
business partner, Marsellus Wallace. You do remember
your business partner, don't you? Now, let me take
a wild guess here. - You're Brett, right?
- Yeah. I thought so. You remember
your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett? Yeah, I remember. Good. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast. Sorry about that.
Whatcha havin'? Hamburgers. Hamburgers! The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast. What kind of hamburgers? - Uh, ch-cheeseburgers.
- No, no, no. Where'd you get 'em?
McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box? - Where?
- Uh, Big Kahuna Burger. Big Kahuna Burger!
That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I hear they got some tasty burgers.
I ain't never had one myself. How are they? They're- They're good. You mind if I try
one of yours? - This is yours here, right?
- Yeah. Mmmm. This is a tasty burger!
Vincent! You ever had
a Big Kahuna burger? Want a bite?
They're real tasty. - I ain't hungry.
- Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually get 'em
'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian, which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian. But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmmm. You know what they call
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese in France? - No.
- Tell 'em, Vincent. - A Royale with Cheese.
- A Royale with Cheese. You know why they call it that? Uh, because of
the metric system? Check out the big brain
on Brett! You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system. - What's in this?
- Sprite. Sprite. Good. You mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with? Go right ahead. [ Slurping, Sighs ] That hit the spot. You. Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here? - Why don't you tell my man Vince here
where you got the shit hid. - It's over- I don't remember askin' you
a goddamned thing! You were sayin'? It's in the cupboard. N-No, the one
by your kn-knees. [ Pans Rattling ] [ Rattling Continues ] [ Hit Man ]

PursuitHappyness,"- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle. - Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner. Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you? I submitted an application for the
intern programme about a month ago... ...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly... Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris. - Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle. Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also. How about we share a ride? - All right, get in.
- All right. So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor... ...who loved to play golf,
hours every day... ...and I would actually
perform medical procedures... ...when he'd leave me in the office. So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and... Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible. - I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can. - That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it. - No, you can't.
- Let me see it. Give it here. Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up. Sorry. It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the centre pieces never move. So if it's yellow in the centre,
that's the yellow side. If it's red in the centre,
that's the red side. - Okay.
- So... You can slow down. Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this. - Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't. - Yes, I can.
- No, you can't. I'm telling you, no one can. See? That's all I ever do. You almost have this side. Holy cow. - You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it. Look at that. You're almost there. - 1710.
- This is me. Good job. - Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon. Where are you going, sir? Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please? Two... A couple of blocks. - Just flip around.
- Okay.",6
SilenceLambs,"You use Evyan skin cream. And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. Did you do all these drawings, Doctor? That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere. You know Florence? All that detail just from memory, sir? Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view. Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us your view
on this questionnaire, sir. Oh, no, no, no. You were doing fine. You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy. You had established trust
with the embarrassing truth about Miggs. And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire. It won't do. I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't. Yeah. Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed, if he is recruiting help
from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill. What a naughty boy he is. Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Please tell me. The newspapers won't say. Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide. They said,
""This one likes to skin his humps."" Why do you think he removes their skins, Agent Starling? Enthrall me with your acumen. It excites him. Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims. I didn't. No. No, you ate yours. You send that through now. Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool? No. I thought that your knowledge... You're so ambitious, aren't you? You know what you look like to me with your good bag and your cheap shoes? You look like a rube. A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste. Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash, are you, Agent Starling? And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed, pure West Virginia. What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp? And, oh, how quickly the boys found you. All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars, while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere, getting all the way to the FBI. You see a lot, Doctor. But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself? What about it? Why don't you... Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see? Maybe you're afraid to. A census-taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans, and a nice Chianti. You fly back to school now, little Starling. Fly, fly, fly. I bit my wrist so I could die.",6
SocialNetwork,"How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SATs? - I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't. I wasn't talking about China anymore,
I was talking about me. You got a 1600? Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group,
but I can't sing. Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong? I could row crew or invent a $25 PC. Or you could get into a final club. Or I get into a final club. You know, from a woman's perspective, sometimes not singing in
an a Capella group is a good thing. This is serious. On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew. Well, I can't do that. I was kidding. And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test. - Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now. - To row crew?
- To get into a final club. To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional? Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once. I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at. But you've seen guys who row crew, right? No. Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes. And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you had met one. I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys. Okay. Should we get something to eat? Would you like to talk
about something else? No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club, I think I may have missed a birthday. There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population... The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc. Which one? The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best. - Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore. Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls who want to party with
the next Fed chairman? So you can see why
it's so important to get in. Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into? - Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking. None of them. That's the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won't come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here. Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer? - He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures. You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance. I... What? You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance. The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one where anybody has the best chance. You didn't ask me which one
was the best one, you asked me which one
was the easiest one. I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask. - Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica. You're obsessed with finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it who will prescribe you
some sort of medication. You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness. Final clubs. Not ""finals clubs."" And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated. Yes. There is. Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code. I didn't mean to be cryptic. I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs. - Why?
- Because they're exclusive. And fun, and they lead to a better life. Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club. He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did. Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be? Did you really just say that? I was kidding. Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true. I wanna try to be straightforward with you and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive. If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings, and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet. You would do that for me? We're dating. Okay. Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you and let you know that we're not anymore. - What do you mean?
- We're not dating anymore. I'm sorry. - Is this a joke?
- No, it's not. You're breaking up with me? You're gonna introduce me to people I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet? What the... What is that supposed to mean? - Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean? Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy. ""The door guy""? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy. The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people. And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon? - Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm. - Is this real?
- Yes. - Then wait, I apologize, okay?
- I have to go study. - Erica?
- Yes? - I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study. Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk. - I can't.
- Why? Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster. All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently... I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance. I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all, and if it seemed rude, then I apologize. - I have to go study.
- You don't have to study. Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study? 'Cause you go to BU. Do you want to get some food? I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education. And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even. - I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends. I was just being polite. I have no intention
of being friends with you. I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class and if we could just order some food,
I think we should... Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person. But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.",6
Zodiac,"Watch your step. Come in. -Very nice house.
-Oh, thank you. It's very rustic. -Can I take your jacket?
-No, thank you, I'm fine. Okay. This way, please. -Have a seat.
-Thank you. -How about some tea?
-Oh, no, I'm all right. -You sure?
-Yes. I wanted to ask you about a film
that the Avenue may have played while you were the organist there. The Most Dangerous Game? Oh, it's a classic. RKO. 1932. Fay Wray, Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks.
We've run that picture many times. In '68, '69? I'd have to check my records. Why? Do you remember the Zodiac? This is about Rick Marshall, isn't it? -He was a projectionist there, right?
-For a time, yes. But I have no occasion
to correspond with him these days. Okay. Well, there is a connection between one of the Zodiac attacks
and that film. You mean the symbol? Hold on. The Zodiac symbol on film.
It's on the countdown. It's trimmed off each reel
before it's shown, but it always arrives with it. Right there. The first time I saw it in the papers,
I thought about that. We got a tip that Rick left a film canister here
that he told you never to open. A tip about a mysterious film canister? Is it true? Yes. -Did you open it?
-No. -May I see it?
-Rick took it back in 1972. This tip is how you got it in your head
that Rick is the Zodiac? That and the poster. The poster? The poster that Rick drew. The handwriting is the closest
that we have ever come to a match. -Rick didn't draw any posters.
-No, he drew this one. Mr. Graysmith, I do the posters myself. That's my handwriting. I won't take any more of your time. Why don't I just go and find out
when we played that film? Oh, that's all right. It's not a problem.
They're just down in the basement. Not many people
have basements in California. I do. You coming, Mr. Graysmith? The original studio one-sheets,
I always kept for myself. The cheapo knock-offs
like you brought today I end up tossing into the back alley. '69. You live alone? Most Dangerous Game ran in May '69. So, that would be about nine weeks before
the first Zodiac letter, correct? Yeah. Do you think he saw the film
in our theater and was inspired? Are you sure
there's nobody else in the house? Would you like
to go upstairs and check? No. Thank you. Thanks for everything. You're welcome. It's locked. Thank you. Good night, Mr. Graysmith!",6
